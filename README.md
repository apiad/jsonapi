# jsonapi

> A minimalistic JSON API framework in Python.

`jsonapi` is heavily inspired by [graphql](https://graphql.org), but aimed at a much simpler use case. The idea is to have a minimal framework for easily building JSON based APIs, that doesn't require any particular frontend technology.

## Instalation

`jsonapi` is a single Python file with no dependencies that you can just clone and distribute with your project's source code:

    git clone https://github.com/apiad/jsonapi
