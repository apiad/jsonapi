# jsonapi

**jsonapi** is heavily inspired by [graphql](https://graphql.org), but aimed at a much simpler use case. The idea is to have a minimal framework for easily building JSON based APIs, that doesn't require any particular frontend technology. The design is inspired in **graphql**'s idea of a single fully customizable endpoint, but instead of defining a specific query language, **jsonapi** is entirely based on JSON both for the query and the response, requires much less boilerplate code, only works in Python, and of course, is much less battle-tested. If you find **graphql** amazing but would like to try a decaffeinated version that you can setup in 10 lines, then give **jsonapi** a shot.
